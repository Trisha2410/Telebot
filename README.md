Chat-bots can be useful in many aspects of the customer experience, including providing customer service, presenting product recommendations and engaging customers through targeted marketing campaigns. 
According to Forbes, the chat-bot market is forecasted to reach $1.25 billion by 2025.

Chat-bots work by analyzing and identifying the intent of the user and give an appropriate response.

The chat-bots work by adopting three classification methods.
Pattern matching: Matches the pattern to group the text and it produces an appropriate response from the clients.

Natural language understanding (NLU): Converts the text into structured data for a machine to understand.  It follows three specific concepts : entities, context, and expectations.

Natural language processing (NLP): Natural Language Processing bots are designed to convert the text or speech inputs of the user into structured data. The data is further used to choose a relevant answer.
